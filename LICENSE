Basically saying, you can't redistribute this code and say you made it.

## You MUST

*A Functionally Equivalent Statement is a code fragment which, regardless of whitespace and object names, achieves the same result within the context of a Minecraft mod or addon. Basically you can't copy the code, rename the variables, add whitespace and say it's different. It's not.

Create addon mods if you want! If you see something that can be improved or a bug that I don't know how to fix, tell me. Submit a Pull Request! One thing: Don't steal please! An enormous amount of effort and time went into this and it's not ok for someone to take this and call it their own.
